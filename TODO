Create, Edit, Delete, etc. for all object types could be generalised?

Backup of changelist name/comments for bash utilities changes:

Title:
[n+m+4] Split Utils.sh into StringUtils, FileUtils, SecurityUtils, ScriptUserUtils, etc. SEE COMMENTS ON CHANGELIST!!!

Comments:
Add hints/reminders of Bash functionality which -doesn't- need to be build with a function (to the appropriate *Utils category), e.g.:
echo ${bar: -2} to print last n characters of string
echo ${bar::-2} to print all of a string excluding the last 2 characters
'if test -f "$FILE"; then' to check if a file exists.

Also add an appropriate prefix to each function name, so it's easy to tell where the file is from the call site.
Use git copy (or whatever the command is) to copy Utils.sh once per file created, so as to preserve VCS history.
