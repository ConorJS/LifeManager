--- Required for app functionality
Comments in Tasks


--- Medium priority
'Processing' overlay when waiting on important async events
Generalise HTTP requests

--- Lower priority
Use form validation for creating/editing items
Return error responses from controllers if things go wrong
Service classes should each have only a singleton mapper, instead of re-initialising mappers per call
Create, Edit, Delete, etc. for all object types could be generalised?
Try to remove setting up 'Postgres' user, if possible, in createDatabase.sql
Move test scripts out of root of Environment folder, only have scratch test here (work on tests here, then move)
