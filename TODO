Utils.sh#print_marker should wrap headings, and be aware of the size of the terminal
Unit tests for download_and_extract_to (including missing ext. case)
Generalise HTTP requests
Rename IPersistableEntity to IPersistable if we don't need this in the domain model
Fix database creation issue
    Re-create by running 'lms' under non-privileged mode, then re-running under privileged mode.
    It seems error flags aren't been preserved after .createDatabase.sql is executed, try and fix this. There might have been another location as well (Flyway script?)
Solidify user(s) list, role(s) list, etc. for Postgres, create README for setting this up, etc.
Try to remove setting up 'Postgres' user, if possible, in createDatabase.sql
Move bash scripts/environment folder so that it is inside project
Move test scripts out of root folder, only have scratch test here (work on tests here, then move)
