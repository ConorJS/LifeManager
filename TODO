Fix database creation issue
    Re-create by running 'lms' under non-privileged mode, then re-running under privileged mode.
    It seems error flags arent been preserved after .createDatabash.sql is executed, try and fix this. There might have been another location as well (Flyway script?)
Solidify user(s) list, role(s) list, etc. for Postgres, create README for setting this up, etc.
Try to remove setting up 'Postgres' user, if possible, in createDatabase.sql
Move test scripts out of root folder, only have scratch test here (work on tests here, then move)
