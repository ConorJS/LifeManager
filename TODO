--- Required for app functionality

Comments in Tasks
Make room for more icons (and related styling)

--- Medium priority
'Processing' overlay when waiting on important async events
Generalise HTTP requests
	This should make it easier to diagnose: "localhost/:1 Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0"


--- Lower priority
Don't use display: none to perform a switch/render for navigation items
Use form validation for creating/editing items
Return error responses from controllers if things go wrong
Service classes should each have only a singleton mapper, instead of re-initialising mappers per call
Create, Edit, Delete, etc. for all object types could be generalised?
Try to remove setting up 'Postgres' user, if possible, in createDatabase.sql
Move test scripts out of root of Environment folder, only have scratch test here (work on tests here, then move)
Standardise casing in UI file names
