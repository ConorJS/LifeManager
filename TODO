'Processing' overlay when waiting on important async events 

Comments in Tasks

Solidify user(s) list, role(s) list, etc. for Postgres, create README for setting this up, etc.
    Protect update/remove endpoints; they should not execute when not executed from within a session owned by the same user which owns the item (will require something comparable to session-scoping)
    
Generalise HTTP requests
	This should make it easier to diagnose: "localhost/:1 Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0"

Add key generation configuration for other (non-To Do task) entities.  

Allow removing tasks/Add 'Active' status to Item interface.

Use form validation for creating/editing items

--- Lower priority
Return error responses from controllers if things go wrong
Service classes should each have only a singleton mapper, instead of re-initialising mappers per call
Create, Edit, Delete, etc. for all object types could be generalised?
Try to remove setting up 'Postgres' user, if possible, in createDatabase.sql
Move bash scripts/environment folder so that it is inside project
Move test scripts out of root folder, only have scratch test here (work on tests here, then move)
